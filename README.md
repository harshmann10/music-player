2. Click again to toggle off.

- Overrides default next-song behavior.

## 🎼 Shuffle + Repeat Together

- **Repeat takes precedence** → current song will loop until turned off.
- After disabling repeat or manually skipping, shuffle determines the next random track.
- This lets you loop a song endlessly but still jump to a random one when desired.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3 (Flexbox, animations, gradients)** for design & responsiveness
- **JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event listeners)** for player logic
